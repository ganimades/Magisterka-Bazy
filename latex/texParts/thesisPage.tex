\textbf{Thesis topic}: \textbf Comparison of performance and methods of implementing databases in iOS\par
\textbf{SUMMARY}: The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of selected databases and how to implement them in iOS. Interface to each database has been implemented separately in a standard way for a given database. The study compared different types of relational databases and NoSQL (column-oriented). Important aspect of the study was to ensure adequate test environments, which may impact the correctness of the results obtained regardless of differences in architecture. The work also presents a comparison of the methods of implementing the tested databases.
