\textbf{Thesis topic}: \textbf Comparison of performance and methods of implementing databases in iOS\par
\textbf{SUMMARY}: The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of selected databases and how to implement them in iOS. Each database has been implemented separately in a standard way for a given database The study compared the different types are typically relational databases and NoSQL (column-oriented), so it was an important aspect of ensuring adequate test environments, which can ensure the correctness of the results obtained regardless of differences in architecture. The work also presents a comparison of the methods of implementing the tested databases.
